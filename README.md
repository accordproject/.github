## Open source software tools for smart legal contracts

The [Accord Project](https://accordproject.org) (a Linux Foundation project) is an open ecosystem enabling anyone to build smart agreements and documents on a technology neutral platform.

The Accord Project is a non-profit, collaborative, initiative developing an ecosystem and open source tools specifically for smart legal contracts. Open source means that anyone can freely use and contribute to development.

Smart agreements promise to reduce friction and transaction costs in the creation and management of commercial relationships. Enabling this future requires the necessary tools to format, share, execute, and manage legally enforceable machine-readable agreements. The Accord Project establishes and maintains a universal legal and technical foundation for smart legal contracts in a technology neutral manner.
